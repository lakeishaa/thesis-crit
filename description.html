      “digital playground” is a home for web experiments (maybe webcam focus?) —
      it is a digitalized physical space that stretches out what one can do with
      the web as a tool. as user's play within the playground, they are
      confronted with the autonomy of turning the camera towards themselves and
      their positionality. <br /><br />
      this website wants to use your camera [block] [allow]<br /><br />
      the design of these interactive webtoys are driven by community and
      constantly changing as the collaborative experiment expands.<br /><br />
      "digital playground" is a space where people engage in art in ways other
      mediums can't do. it is less about the individual and more about the
      people.
